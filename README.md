# webflow-to-sanity-migration

Migrate a published Webflow site into a Sanity project.

> **This repository is the public slice of [FocusReactive's](https://focusreactive.com) internal migration tooling, and it is cut down in two ways.** It covers one path only — Webflow → Sanity — and the pipeline behind that path is itself a simplified, but not hollowed out version of the internal one, though — it runs end-to-end on its own and hands you a working project.

## What you get

A pnpm/turbo workspace with a `studio` package and a `web` package, generated from the live site:

- **Document types** for every Webflow CMS collection, with their fields typed and their items
  seeded into the dataset
- **Section blocks** as real React components, registered in the page builder and composable in
  the studio
- **Header and footer** as chrome documents, rendered by the app shell
- **Design tokens** — colours, type scale, spacing, radii, shadows — as CSS variables
- **Images and videos** as Sanity image and file assets, referenced by the content that uses them
- **Webfonts** copied into the project and served from it
- **A seed** that fills the dataset from the migration's own artifacts, so the project has content
  the first time you open it

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
```

## Usage

Launch Claude Code and call migration skill:

```
/migrate https://your-webflow-site
```

The migration runs in a workspace beside this repository (`../migrations/<project-name>` by
default, set in `migrate.config.json`); this repository is never written to by a run.

## How it works

Ten phases, in execution order:

| phase           | what it does                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `probe`         | fetches the home page, `robots.txt`, the sitemap and a 404 page                       |
| `detect`        | scores the home page against the Webflow signal registry and gates the run            |
| `inventory`     | crawls the site into its page list and its CMS collections                            |
| `snapshot`      | freezes every page: raw HTML, post-hydration DOM, computed styles, screenshots        |
| `assets`        | inventories every image, video and font family behind a stable asset id               |
| `design-tokens` | reads the frozen styles into a token set and emits the theme                          |
| `discovery`     | names the page's blocks, the site's globals and its collections                       |
| `synth`         | authors each surface: field schema, content, and a React component                    |
| `layout`        | composes each route from block instances with their field values                      |
| `generate`      | writes the Sanity Studio + Next.js project, then installs, seeds, builds and lints it |

Run state lives in the project's `.migration/` directory: `manifest.json` records every step and
its status, and `artifacts/` holds the intermediate representation each phase reads and writes.
Every step is idempotent and every run is resumable — point the skill at an existing project and it
picks up at the first step that is not `done`.
