# Detecting Webflow from a published page

A published Webflow site can be identified from a single page fetch, with no API access and no
credentials. The reliable evidence is not one marker but a set of them: attributes on the `<html>`
tag, an HTML comment Webflow's publisher writes, asset URLs on Webflow's CDN, `w-*` class names its
runtime depends on, and a handful of response headers. Any one of these can be copied, cached, or
proxied away by a third party, so a trustworthy verdict comes from scoring several of them together
and requiring at least one that is hard to fake.

This is how the `detect` phase in this repository gates a migration run: it scores 42 signals
against the home page and refuses to continue unless the result clears both a numeric threshold and
a structural condition.

## Which markers identify a Webflow page?

The strongest evidence sits on the `<html>` tag, where Webflow's publisher writes the site's own
identifiers:

| attribute            | value shape       | meaning                                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `data-wf-page`       | 24 hex characters | page id                                    |
| `data-wf-site`       | 24 hex characters | site id                                    |
| `data-wf-domain`     | hostname          | the host the site was published to         |
| `data-wf-collection` | 24 hex characters | present only on a CMS collection template  |
| `data-wf-item-slug`  | slug              | present only on a CMS collection item page |

Next to those, five more kinds of evidence appear in the document itself:

- **The publisher's comment.** `<!-- Last Published: … GMT+0000 -->`. The fixed `GMT+0000` suffix is
  part of the pattern; Webflow writes publish timestamps in UTC.
- **Stylesheet and script URLs carrying the site id.** `website-files.com/<24hex>/css/*.min.css` and
  `website-files.com/<24hex>/js/`, plus the site-chunk marker `.schunk.<16hex>.js`, and jQuery
  served from `d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-<version>.min.<hash>.js?site=<24hex>`.
- **The touch-detection script** Webflow inlines in `<head>`, recognisable by the pair `t=" w-mod-"`
  and `DocumentTouch` appearing together.
- **Runtime class names.** `w-nav`, `w-dyn-list` / `w-dyn-items` / `w-dyn-item`, `w--current`,
  `w-inline-block`, `w-richtext`, `w-embed`, `w-condition-invisible`, and the widget family
  (`w-form`, `w-input`, `w-button`, `w-dropdown`, `w-tabs`, `w-slider`, `w-lightbox`, `w-checkbox`,
  `w-container`, `w-clearfix`, `w-icon-*`, `w-layout-grid`).
- **Response headers.** Any `x-wf-*` header, an `x-lambda-id` holding a UUID, a `surrogate-key`
  containing both a 24-hex site id and `pageId:`, and `surrogate-control: max-age=432000`.

## How much evidence is enough?

Each signal carries a tier, and each tier a weight: `strong` = 3, `medium` = 2, `weak` = 1. The
registry holds 22 strong, 14 medium and 6 weak signals. A page needs a total of **6** to be called
Webflow.

Two rules keep that number honest.

**Families are capped.** Related signals are grouped, and a group contributes at most 6 regardless
of how many of its members hit. Two groups exist: `wf-w-classes` (9 signals) and `wf-assets` (4).
Without the cap, a page that merely copied Webflow's stylesheet would clear the threshold on class
names alone: all nine `w-*` signals hitting scores 21, more than three times what a verdict needs.
Capping the group at 6 forces corroboration from an unrelated kind of evidence.

**A weak-but-broad pile is not a verdict.** Clearing 6 is necessary but not sufficient: the run also
requires at least one strong signal marked as observable in the page's own HTML — nine signals carry
that flag — or the one `instant` signal, a host ending in `.webflow.io`, which alone satisfies the
threshold because a Webflow staging domain cannot be anything else. Headers, `robots.txt`, the
sitemap and the 404 page all contribute score, but none of them can carry a verdict by itself: a CDN
or a reverse proxy in front of a non-Webflow origin can produce header-shaped evidence.

Anything short of both conditions yields `unknown`, and the migration stops rather than guessing.

Some signals are deliberately conditional rather than absolute. Cloudflare's fingerprint
(`server: cloudflare`, `cf-ray`, a `_cfuvid` cookie) counts only when a Webflow-specific header is
present alongside it — on its own it identifies a CDN, not a platform. Similarly,
`cdn.prod.website-files.com` counts as strong evidence when the URL contains the same site id found
on the `<html>` tag, and otherwise only after five or more occurrences.
